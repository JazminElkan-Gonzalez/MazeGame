For Part 3 of our rendition of Golden Runner, we implemented loading levels from levels.txt. There needs to be a single "\n" of whitespace between levels for this implementation to work. The two test levels are currently near identical in structure and design. 

It is extremely tricky to solve the puzzle and avoid the enemies, so we allowed the player to, if they are moving fast enough and have a measure of luck, sprint/dodge past the enemy. 



The project was not too hard or easy. We enjoyed that there was not too much of an initial start structure. We had to figure out for ourselves how to do the event queue and other funtionality.
